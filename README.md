# The pyoscillot simulation suite

Welcome to the pyoscillot simulation suite, developed to create synthetic HARPS, CARMENES_VIS and CARMENES_NIR spectra including the effect of stellar (non-)radial oscillations.
We can also simulate stellar spots and planetary signals (to some extent). 

This README will soon be expanded to include help for installation and use. Stay tuned!
